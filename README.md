 Service Desk Automation (O365 + ITSM)

A backend automation system that simulates how IT service desk tickets can be automatically created, classified, prioritized, assigned, and tracked using rule-based logic and REST APIs.

This project demonstrates real-world automation thinking rather than UI-heavy implementation.

 Problem Statement

Traditional service desks rely on manual ticket creation, which leads to:

Delayed ticket registration

Incorrect team assignment

SLA breaches

Reduced employee productivity

Solution Overview

This project automates the end-to-end service desk workflow:

Issues raised via O365 (Outlook / Teams) are processed automatically

Tickets are classified as Incident or Service Request

Priority and SLA are assigned

Tickets are routed to the correct support team

Users are notified instantly

External systems like O365 and ITSM tools are simulated to keep the solution lightweight and interview-focused.

 Key Features

✅ Rule-based ticket classification

✅ Automatic priority & SLA assignment

✅ Keyword-based team routing

✅ REST API–driven backend

✅ Clean layered architecture

✅ Easy to extend and scale
